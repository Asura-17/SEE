Mini Calculator 🧮✨

A simple Python program that takes two numbers as input and calculates their sum, difference, product, and quotient.
Perfect for beginners learning about user input, type conversion, and basic arithmetic operations in Python.

📌 Features

Accepts decimal numbers using float() (not just integers).

Performs:

Addition ➕

Subtraction ➖

Multiplication ✖️

Division ➗

Friendly and humorous inline comments to make learning fun!

🛠 How It Works

The program asks the user to enter two numbers.

It calculates:

sum_result → First number + Second number

difference_result → First number - Second number

product_result → First number × Second number

quotient_result → First number ÷ Second number

It displays all results in a clean format.

🚀 How to Run

Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your computer.

Save the script as mini_calculator.py.

Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the file location, and run:

python mini_calculator.py


Follow the on-screen instructions to enter two numbers.

⚠️ Notes

The program does not handle division by zero — if you enter 0 as the second number, Python will throw an error.

You can extend this program to handle such cases using try/except blocks.

📖 Example Run
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 4
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 14.0
Difference: 6.0
Product: 40.0
Quotient: 2.5

💡 Possible Improvements

Add error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero.

Allow the user to choose the operation instead of running all four.

Add looping so the user can perform multiple calculations without restarting.
